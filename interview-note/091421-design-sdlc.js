Design pattern used in the daily work
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/react-design-patterns/
Design patterns are repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development.
Design patterns not only speed up the development process but also make the code easier to read and to maintain. 
Some common examples of design patterns include the Singleton pattern and the Gang-of-Four pattern.

In software development, design patterns are associated with two common roles.
- Offer a common platform to developers
Singleton: This pattern postulates the use of a single object. 
Developers implementing this pattern can easily communicate to other developers that a particular program follows the singleton pattern and they will understand what this means. 
- Ensure best practices
Design patterns have been created as a result of extensive research and testing. 
They not only allow developers to become easily accustomed to the development environment but also ensure that the best practices are being followed.
This results in fewer errors and saves time during debugging and figuring out problems that could have been easily avoided if an appropriate design pattern had been implemented.

Unidirectional Data Flow
The pattern of applying one-way mutations on an immutable data state is called Unidirectional Data Flow.
React does not support bi-directional binding to make sure you are following a clean data flow architecture. 
The major benefit of this approach is that data flows throughout your app in a single direction, giving you better control over it. 
In terms of React it means: state is passed to the view and to child components.

JSX - Full power of javascript
reusable react components - richer user interfaces for web apps
These React components can be considered as a small system in itself. Each component has its own state, input as well as output. 
The input of a component is taken in the form of props. The component may be considered as a black box. Each having its own state and lifecycle. Components are easy to compose.
The final react app consists of a highly maintainable code.

Component - stateful, stateless
The state is simply the data that is imported into a component. 
In stateless components, you can not reach this.state inside it.  such components always render the same thing or only what is passed to them via props. 
For a hierarchy of components, the best practice is to let parent components keep as much state as possible and make stateless child components. Data can be passed down via props. 

Conditional Rendering
In the process of writing React components, the need often arises to render a certain JSX code based on the state. This is achieved through conditional rendering. 

Render Props
sharing code between React components using a prop

Controlled Components - handling form state.
The controlled component takes the state through props. It can notify any changes by means of callbacks like onChange. 
Parent components can control it by handling the callback and managing its own state; meanwhile, the new values are passed to the controlled component as props.

Callbacks
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument,
is a great way to handle something after something else has been completed.

React Hooks
create your own hooks. This allows you to extract the component logic and create reusable functions.


What is a design system? 
A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Singleton pattern
The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance. 
  it is used in object-oriented programming that ensures only a single instance of an object exists within a system at any given time (globally accessible).
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, 
  useful for things like loggers, state managers, and other objects that need to be globally accessible across an application.

A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. 
Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and in this way one can ensure that they do not accidentally create, say, two Users in a single User application.
By design, singletons create an instance of a class if it does not yet exist. Otherwise, they return the reference to an existing instance.

What is a singleton hook?
Singleton hooks very similar to React Context in terms of functionality. 
Each singleton hook has a body, you might think of it as of Context Provider body. 
Hook has a return value, it is similar to the value provided by context. 
Using a singleton hook from a component is like consuming a context.
Singleton hooks are lazy. The body is not executed until the hook is called by some component or other hook. 
Once loaded, the hook body remains loaded forever. 
If you want to eager-load some Singleton hooks, use them at the top-level component of your App.


HOC in react, why do we need to use them?
takes a component and returns a new component under a certain reusing component logic pattern
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

When do you need to use a class component, when do you use a functional component?
class - local state, lifecycle
functions - other than above, with the help of hooks, everything


Software Engineering
Agile Scrum
Sprint: 2 - 3 weeks
Scrum team: 3 to 9 people

Product Owner: release management
  scrum manegment - what should team do for each scrum
  communicate with clients, gathering requirements => put into backlog
  backlog management
Scrum Master: host meetings
  in the planning meetings or retrospective
  non-technical
Business Analysis: they will get stories, separate them into tickets
Development Team:
  team leader
  front-end developer 2-4
  back-end developer 3-5
Tester Team:
  QA: quality assurance 3
UI/UX designer: creating mock up for front-end developers

Sprint Planning Meeting
  - 2 hours of sprint planning for every 1 week of sprint length
  - develop realistic Sprint backlog and define the highest priority tasks
  - scrums will assign tickets to developers
  - JIRA ticket => we need to discuss how long a developer should take to finish
  - story points: if you have a ticket which is more than 5 story points, most likely you are trying to separate it
  - for each sprint, you will get around 10 points
Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
  - held at the end of a particular project or sprint, 45 minutes for each week of sprint length.
  - scrum master is giving feedback to the whole team 
  - all team members give feedback on what we did good, bad, what to improve
  - reflect back on the work and what improvements are needed to be made. 
Sprint Review Meeting
  - At the end of each Sprint, demonstrates the functionality of the product and what has been achieved during a particular Sprint. 
Backlog Refinement Meeting
  - product backlog items need refinement for the next Sprint, to make the team understand them better for successful execution.
  
Sprint demo: each of the developer should make presentation
Back Refinement: check backlog, move backlog tickets to active sprint/future sprint
Business Meeting: communicate with clients

Daily Meetings
- Daily Stand-ups / Daily Scrum Meeting: 
  - What did you do yesterday? 
  - What will you do today? 
  - What (if anything) is blocking your progress?
- Daily Tag-ups Meeting: 
  - Get updates for today and solve blockers
  
Sprint cycle
- Sprints are developmental cycles that repeat until your project is complete. 
- Requirements (often in the form of user stories) are developed, tested, integrated, and approved within each sprint.
- And the process continues sprint after sprint. The figure depicts a one-week sprint life cycle.
