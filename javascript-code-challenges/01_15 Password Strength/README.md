# 01_15 Password Strength

## What You'll Do

You're building a sign up component and need to validate whether a user's desired password is secure enough.

Given a password (string) return true if the password meets the following criteria and false if it doesn't.

Password criteria:

- One lowercase letter
- One uppercase letter
- One special character (!@#\$%^&\*)
- One number
- At least 8 characters long

## Requirements

- Use regex to test whether the password is valid
- Use a ternary operator to return "Your password is valid" if it meets all requirements and "Your password is not valid, try again" if it doesn't.

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
