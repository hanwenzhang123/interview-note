# 01_10 Food Truck

## What You'll Do

You're organizing a food truck festival with many different vendors. Each vendor has a menu and some vendors might be serving the same item.

Given an array of food truck menus, return one master menu which contains all food items to be served, without duplicates.

```
Input: [['Tacos', 'Burgers'], ['Pizza'], ['Burgers', 'Fries']]
Output:
- Tacos
- Burgers
- Pizza
- Fries

```

## Requirements

- Use Sets
- Dynamically generate list items containing the unique menu items
- Use the spread operator

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
