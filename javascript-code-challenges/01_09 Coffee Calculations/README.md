# 01_09 Coffee Calculations

## What You'll Do

You and a group of friends have spent all day hanging out at a coffee shop. Each person has ordered some number of coffees, and you want to pay the entire bill.

Given an array of integers > 0 representing the number of coffees each friend ordered, calculate the total price of all coffees. Each coffee costs `$1.25`.

## Requirements

- Use array.reduce()
- Use template literals

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
