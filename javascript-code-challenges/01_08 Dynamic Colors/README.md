# 01_08 Dynamic Colors

## What You'll Do

Create three buttons: blue, pink, and green. When each button is clicked, you should set the background of the document body to the selected color.

## Requirements

- Use closures

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
