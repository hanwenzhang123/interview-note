# 01_11 Train Stops

## What You'll Do

Create a generator function called `getStop` which yields different stops on the trainline from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Station.

The stops are as follows:

- Poughkeepsie
- Newburgh
- Peekskill
- Yonkers
- Bronx
- Grand Central

You will have a button with an id of `next-stop` that, when clicked, will console log the next stop or if the end of the line has been reached will console log "We made it!"

## Requirements

- Use a generator function

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
