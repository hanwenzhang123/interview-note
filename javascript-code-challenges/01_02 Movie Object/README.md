# 01_02 Movie Object

## What You'll Do

Create a Movie object that takes in five arguments:

- title
- director
- genre
- releaseYear
- rating

Add a function called `getOverview` on the Movie prototype which console
logs the following overview for each film:

"<movie>, a <genre> film directed by <director> was released in <releaseYear>. It received a rating of <rating>."

## Requirements

- Use object prototypes

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
