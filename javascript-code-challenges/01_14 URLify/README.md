# 01_14 URLify

## What You'll Do

Create a function called urlify which takes in a blog title and outputs a url-friendly string where each word is lowercase and spaces are replaced with hyphens. Remember to remove all apostrophes.

```
("How I Got Into Programming!!!") => "how-i-got-into-programming"
```

## Requirements

- String manipulation

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
