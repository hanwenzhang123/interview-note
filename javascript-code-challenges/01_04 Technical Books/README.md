# 01_04 Technical Books

## What You'll Do

Expanding on your previous book application you now want to create a class for technical books. Using the Book class constructed in the last example, extend the functionality to the new TechnicalBook class.

The new TechnicalBook class will take a book edition as a fifth argument.

You should add a getEdition method which prints `The current version of this book is ${version}`.

## Requirements

- Use JavaScript's class notation

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
