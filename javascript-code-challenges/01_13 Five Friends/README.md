# 01_13 Five Friends

## What You'll Do

You're working on a new component for"Your Space", a brand new social media application for finding friends. This component displays a user's top five friends.

Given some JSON, dynamically generate thumbnails for the top five friends. You can append these thumbnails to the `<div id="timeline"></div>`.

## Requirements

- Use the random user API: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5
- Use async/await
- Use fetch()
- Use DOM manipulation to dynamically generate five medium-sized images for each person

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
