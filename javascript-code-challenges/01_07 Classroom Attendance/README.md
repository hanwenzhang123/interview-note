# 01_07 Classroom Attendance

## What You'll Do

Given an object, classroom, return an array of student names

- The classroom object is structured with two values: hasTeachingAssistant (boolean) and classList (array of strings)

```js
  {
    hasTeachingAssistant: false,
    classList: ["Rashida", "John", "Roman", "Lisa", "Omair", "Lukas"],
  }
```

- The teacher will always be the first item in the classList array
- If `hasTeachingAssitant` is true, the teaching assistant will be the second item in the classList array

## Requirements

- Use object and array destructuring

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `begin.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.

If you get stuck or want to see the final solution, you can check out the `end.js` file. To run the solution, comment the `<script src="./start.js"><script>` line and uncomment the `<script src="./end.js></script>` line.
