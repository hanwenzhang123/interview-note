Hierarchical Structure

Linked lists or arrays - linear 
Trees - zero or more child nodes

A tree usually starts with a single root node or a parent node, and every child of the tree descends from the root node, from only one parent
child-parent relationship, directional, going one way

leaf nodes, very end of a tree data structure
within a tree, you can have sub-trees
Abstract syntax tree

Using trees, we have nodes that contains any type of information we want, quite like linked-list but it is linear, from top to bottom
There are many different type of trees, and each tree we can have for a specific use case


Balanced BST
lookup - O(log N)
insert - O(log N)
delete - O(log N)

Binary Tree
lookup - O(n)
insert - O(log N)
delete - O(log N)
