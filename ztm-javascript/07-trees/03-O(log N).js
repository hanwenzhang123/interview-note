Level 0: 2^0 = 1;
level 1: 2^1 = 2;
level 2: 2^2 = 4;
level 3: 2^3 = 8;

# of nodes = 2^h-1  //the height, -1 
# of nodes = 2^h  //we drop -1 because it is insignificant
log nodes = height //simplify

log 100 = 2
10 ^ 2 = 100
log - based on the height, the maximum number of decisions

//O(log N)
the choice of the next element on which to perform some sort of action is one of several possibilities
and only one needs to be chosen, we do not have to check both.

think it like check through a phone book, we do actually check every single person in a phone book
instead, you do divide and conquer by looking based on where their names alphabetically begin.
you only need to explore a subset of each section before you eventually find someone

O(log N) is really fast, very good
 
tree data structure can be very fast for searching, like google search
