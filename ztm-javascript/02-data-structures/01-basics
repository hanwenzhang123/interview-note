Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs

Data Structures - A collection of values
Algorithms - Steps and processes we put in place to manipulate this collection of values that allows us to write programs

What is a Data Structure?
Data structure allows us to organize the data, so we can go back to that data and retrieve the data
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

Which code is better?
Readable
Memory - Space Complexity
Speed - Time Complexity

How Computers Store Data?
CPU - Computer runs by CPU, CPU Cache (tiny) stores memory that is very recent
RAM (adderss, bit, byte) - Fast to access to memory through memory controler, but you lose the memory when computer shut off 
Storage (Video, Photo, Music, Documents) - information is always there
