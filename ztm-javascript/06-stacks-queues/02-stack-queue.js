//Both are good, depends on the use
//Arrays 
 - cache locality: make it faster when accessing its items in memory
 - static or dynamic array but limited memory, double up the memory once it reaches the limit
//Linked Lists 
 - slower: scattered all over memory; also extra memory because we have to hold on pointers
 - more dynamic memory

//Linked List better than Arrays
//Arrays
- tracked by indexes, we have to shift over the list once it changes
- O(n) - linear time
//Linked Lists 
- we have pointer which is better to track the head O(1)
