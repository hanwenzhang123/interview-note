algorithms 
  - the functions that programmers write
The algorithms are simply steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers.

data structures and algorithms create programs
algorithms allow us to use data structures to perform actions on that data.

Big O and scalability of code is important as companies get larger and larger
Certain algorithms allow us to simplify our big O complexity into smaller or better time complexity.
As big company handles lots of inputs and lots of data, this topic is important 
   
Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs 
class{} + function () = programs

Algorithms
- sorting
- dynmaic programming
- BFS + DFS (searching)
- recursion
