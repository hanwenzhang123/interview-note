//Graphs
- useful and most used data structure for real life
- like a little network, how internet works, like friendship, family trees
- each item is called a node (vertex)
- nodes are connected by edges (Edge)
- with graphs, you can have information on both nodes and edges

//Types of Graphs
directed graph
- directed (go one direction, like one way street)
- undirected (highway between two cities you can go back forth)
facebook - undirected graph, if you add someone as a friend, the person has you in their network as well
twitter - directed, if someone follows you, you do not have to follow them

weighted graph
- unweighted 
  without information on edges
- weighted (calculate ultimate path, fastest way to get to point a to point b) 
  with information on edges

cyclic graph
- cyclic (common in weighted graph like google map, back and forth ways)
  cycle, one node to another to another and back to the origin node
- acyclic 
  you can not back to the origin node

//pros vs cons
Pros
- Relationship

Cons
- Scaling is hard
