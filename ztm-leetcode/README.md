1. step 1: verify the constraints
2. step 2: write out some test cases
3. step 3: figure out a solution without code
4. step 4: write out our solution in code
5. step 5: double check for errors
6. step 6: test our code with our test cases
7. step 7: space & time complexity
8. step 8: can we optimize our solution?
