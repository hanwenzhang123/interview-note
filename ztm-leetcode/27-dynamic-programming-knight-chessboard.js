//Knight Probability In Chessboard

On an n x n chessboard, a knight starts at the cell (row, column) and attempts to make exactly k moves. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, so the top-left cell is (0, 0), and the bottom-right cell is (n - 1, n - 1).

Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 0.06250

Input: n = 1, k = 0, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 1.00000
